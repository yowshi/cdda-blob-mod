this is a file just for ideas do not actually put it into the final mod.

blaze gave us some guns so we dont have to worry about that. 

alternate gear though, using blob feed.
water purifier, possibility of creating tiny amounts of blob feed from water?
blob armour- heavy light and medium, 
passive defensive clothing type stuff, think tesla coil addon from fallout 4's power armour
chameleon blob suit, predator style blob based cloaking.
flash light? probably some kind of lamp.
blob replacement for survivor clothes?

it would be really awesome if we could get this stuff to self heal using the blob feed. maybe damage done to charge and when the charges
run out the item disintegrates?
